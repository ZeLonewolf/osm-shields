      The author of the code wishes to acknowledge the yeoman work of
      Phil! Gold, Richard Weait, Minh Nguyen, Toby Murray, and other 
      contributors in compiling and
      organizing the shield templates in their [earlier project](https://launchpad.net/osm-shields).
      Without that work, this further refinement would have been
      impossible. As a matter of courtesy, and not of law, the author
      requests that they and he be acknowledged in other projects
      that depend on this work. 
      
      _It is known that the contributor
      list is incomplete_, since contributor information was lost 
      inadvertently in converting the project from the earlier
      repository. Contact the [project administrator](mailto:kevin.b.kenny+github@gmail.com)
      if you believe that you made an unacknowledged contribution, and we'll
      try to make things right!
