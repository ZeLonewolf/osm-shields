    <p>The individual highway shield templates in
      the <tt>templates/</tt> directory are all believed to be
      unencumbered by copyright in the United States.  To the extent
      that they are the subject of trademark, it is believed that the
      use in this project is nominative: that is, the protected marks
      are all used to name and apply to the objects that the marks are
      intended to designate.</p>

    <p>The author of the code wishes to acknowledge the yeoman work of
      Phil! Gold, Richard Weait, Minh Nguyen, Toby Murray, and other 
      contributors in compiling and
      organizing the shield templates in their
      <a href="https://launchpad.net/osm-shields">earlier project.</a>
      Without that work, this further refinement would have been
      impossible. As a matter of courtesy, and not of law, the author
      requests that they and he be acknowledged in other projects
      that depend on this work. <i>It is known that the contributor
      list is incomplete</i>, since contributor information was lost 
      inadvertently in converting the project from the earlier
      repository. Contact the <a href="mailto:kevin.b.kenny@gmail.com">
      project administrator</a> if you believe that you made an
      unacknowledged contribution.</p>
